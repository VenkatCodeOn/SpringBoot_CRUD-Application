# SpringBoot_CRUD-Application

Create, Read, Update and Delete are the four basic functions of persistent storage. These operations are usually referred to using the acronym CRUD. 
Within a database each of these operations map directly to a series of commands, however their relationship with a RESTful API is slightly more complex.
This CRUD operation is based on Employee Details.


HTTP 
POST - CREATE a new entity and add to the context.	CREATE or UPDATE an attribute of a specified entity.
GET -	READ entity data from the context. This will return data from multiple entities. The data can be filtered.	READ entity data from a specified entity. This will return data from a single entity only. The data can be filtered.
PUT	- UPDATE an entity from the context
PATCH	-❌	❌
DELETE-	DELETE an entity from the context
